# Towers of Hanoi for Algorithms and Data Structures COSC3320 

## Problem
Solve the Towers of Hanoi game for the following graph G=(V,E) with V={Start, Aux1,Aux2, Aux3,Dest} 
and E ={(Start,Aux1), (Aux1,Aux2), (Aux2,Aux3), (Aux3,Aux1),(Aux3,Dest)}.

* Design an algorithm and determine the time and space complexities of moving n disks form Start to Dest.

* Implement this algorithm whereby your program prints out each of the moves of every disk. Show the output for n=1,2,...10.
