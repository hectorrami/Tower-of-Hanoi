# Towers of Hanoi 

## Problem
Solve the Towers of Hanoi game for the following graph G=(V,E) with V={Start, Aux1,Aux2, Aux3,Dest} 
and E ={(Start,Aux1), (Aux1,Aux2), (Aux2,Aux3), (Aux3,Aux1),(Aux3,Dest)}.

* Design an algorithm and determine the time and space complexities of moving n disks form Start to Dest.

* Implement this algorithm whereby your program prints out each of the moves of every disk. Show the output for n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

## Solution

#### Input
For input, this program takes an integer n, where n is the number of disks the user wants to solve for the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.

#### Assumptions
n is a number between 1 and 10, inclusive. Disks can only move to adjacent pegs. For example, the disk cannot travel from A1 directly to A3, the disk must travel from A1 to A2 and A2 to A3. Otherwise, the move is considered illegal. The Start peg cannot be moved onto again, and the Dest peg cannot be moved off once the disk has been moved onto it. The only disk that allows us to backtrack in this case is Aux3 from Aux3 to Aux1.
#### Time and Space Complexity
considering the restrictions on the algorithm that needs to implement to solve the Tower of Hanoi using 5 pegs, the time complexity would be derived from the number of recursive calls. For this algorithm there are 3 recursive calls so r =3 and d =1 because when n =1 disk 1 moves from the start to dest peg (base case).Using Master Theorem for time complexity:The time complexity for this F(n) = 3n/1 algorithm is O(3n).
The space complexity is O(n) because the recursive shifts are independent of each n (constant). The space complexity would then be linear.
